I want to create a game story plot that has some choices to move to another chapter, and also additional puzzles to solve during the gameplay to continue (but not very tricky)
There is our draft of the game plot, but each chapter is too long, and I also want it to tackle a specific mental illness, or maybe some, but not many. It needs to be clear, and in each ending, there are some details about that mental illness.
Help me implement this game, and also suggest a name for this. Here are some detail of the the challenge:
# Overview
For this challenge, students will vibe code using LLMs to design and develop a web-based game that highlights and addresses a pressing social challenge in Vietnam or Australia. The game should be fun to play, educational, and impactful - giving players a fresh perspective on important real-world issues.
# Description
You are required to vibe code a game using any LLMs that you find suitable to achieve the goals. The aim is to deliver a complete web game that fits the theme:
The game should take the form of a board game, card game, dice game, or any game topic of simple web game format.
- The gameplay mechanics must directly connect to the chosen social issue, making the game both educational and engaging.
- Suggested themes may include (but are not limited to):
  - Climate change & sustainability
  - Access to education
  - Mental health & wellbeing
  - Social equity & inclusion
  - Community resilience
  - So on
Contestants need to decide on topics that suit their local context (either Vietnam or Australia).

Additional guidelines:

- Game assets (sprites, backgrounds, sound effects, code logics, etc.) can also be generated using your choices of AI models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Nano Banana, Sora, …, where appropriate.
- The game must only use HTML, CSS and Javascript. Feel free to use any HTML, CSS and JavaScript libraries/frameworks as long as it can run fully on the browser (only on front-end) without a need to install any additional installation or setup or backend.
