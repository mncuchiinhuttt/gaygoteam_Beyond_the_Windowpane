                Chapter 1: The Weight of Second Place
              </h2>
            </header>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              You can feel the tension of the classroom, thick with the scent of old paper and nervous sweat. The math teacher, a man whose smile was as rare as a perfect score, is handing back the midterms. An's heart isn't just beating; it's a frantic drum against his ribs.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              It's not even that he was scared of failing. He knew he hadn't. He was just terrified of not getting a perfect score. The paper landed on his desk, face down. He held his breath, hoping. He flipped it over. A 9.5 out of 10. It was circled in this super bright red ink.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              An excellent score for anyone else, but for An, it's a glaring spotlight on his one stupid mistake. He could totally picture it--the one careless calculation, the moment of overconfidence. Then, the teacher put the class rankings up on the screen. And sure enough, his name was right there, right under Minh's. Second.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              That one word, 'Second', just felt like a judgement. Dinner that night was uncomfortably quiet. All that could be heard was the clinking of chopsticks. It just felt like a countdown to 'the talk'.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              Finally, his mother cleared her throat. "I saw the class list your teacher posted," her voice was really calm... too calm. "Second place is very good, An. We're proud." An just knew what was coming next. There was always a 'but'.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              And sure enough, she said, "But... your cousin Minh got a perfect 10! His parents must be so proud. You're just as smart as him. You just need to focus a little more, and stop getting distracted. I know you can be the best."
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              And she probably thought she was encouraging him, a push of confidence for him. But to An, it just felt like she was dropping stones in his pockets, making him feel worthless. His chest just got all tight.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              He wanted to scream and tell his mom that he studied until his eyes blurred, that he gave it everything he had. But he just... couldn't say anything. The words were all caught in his throat, like he was just stuck between feeling like a failure and trying to be a good son.
            </p>
            <p class="italic text-white/70">
              HE THOUGHT: "Focus more? Are you kidding me? How? I barely sleep as it is. I already gave up playing football with my friends. What else do they even want from me? It's like... why is nothing I do ever good enough for them?"

              The "try harder" thing just becomes his motto. It's all he thinks about. He's getting up at 5 AM just to memorize chemistry formulas, skipping lunch to finish physics homework. His whole life just shrunk down to the four walls of his bedroom.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              The only 'sun' he ever saw was his desk lamp. You know the foggy feeling you get when you're exhausted? For him, it just kept getting thicker. It wasn't just a feeling anymore; it felt... physical, like a weight. He had this dull headache all the time that just wouldn't go away.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              Food tasted like nothing... like ash. He'd look in the mirror and not even recognize himself - just this tired-looking kid with huge dark circles under his eyes.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              So then, his literature teacher, Ms. Mai, pulls him aside after class. She's holding his last essay. She just says, "An, this isn't like you. The analysis is pretty shallow, and the writing... it just feels tired. Your grades are slipping in all your classes."
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              And she's looking at him with pity. Which, honestly, felt even worse than if she'd been mad. She says, "School policy means I have to refer you to the school counselor. Maybe talking to Mr. Binh can help you... get your motivation back."
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              And An's just standing there, thinking: "Motivation? It's not motivation I'm lacking. It's... something else. Like a spark. A reason. But... maybe she's right. Maybe I do need a different kind of help. What if this guy, Mr. Binh, actually gets it?"

              What he said just hangs in the air. His mother's face tightened up. It wasn't that she was mad. It was something worse - this deep, sad disappointment.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              She said: "Studying hard is your duty, An. Being the best is how you repay us. Don't make any excuses." The rest of the dinner is awfully quiet, just suffocating. And for the next few days, it was like a cold war in the house.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              His mom would still pack his lunch and ask about his homework, but the warmth is gone. It felt like her love now is conditional, like he has to earn it by winning awards or getting the top grades.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              All that tension makes it impossible to focus. At school, he'd just stare at the blackboard, and all the numbers and letters swim together. His best friend, Linh, totally noticed. She sounds casual, but her eyes are serious.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              She kinda corners him by the water cooler. She's just like, "Okay, spill it," her tone light but her eyes serious. "You look like you're carrying the whole world on your shoulders. What's up? Fight with your parents?"
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              And he's just thinking, "If I tell her, is she even going to get it? Or is she just gonna say, 'Your mom's right, just study?' She's my friend, but... does anyone really get this kind of pressure? But goodness, holding all this in... I feel like I'm going to burn out."

              His room became his own world. He closed the door, and the silence felt like such a relief. It's better than dealing with the judgment and all expectations.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              He started having his meals there, claiming that he had too much homework. He put on his headphones, not to listen to music, but to use them as a shield, a "do not disturb" sign for the world.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              The next morning, An went to school in a really bad mood. During the break, his best friend, Linh, tried to cheer him up: "Come on, An, come and play with us!".
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              He looked up from his book, the words meaningless squiggled on the page. Just like the thought of them all laughing and talking... it just felt so exhausting. It's like a language he'd forgotten how to speak.
            </p>
            <p class="italic text-white/70">
              HE THOUGHT: I should go. That's the normal thing to do. But then... I'd have to smile. I'd have to pretend I actually care about all their gossip and jokes. It's just easier to stay here. It's safer. But God... it's so lonely.

            <p class="text-white/70">
              The "counselor's office" is a storage closet with a desk. The man behind it, Mr. Binh, is the school's head of discipline. He doesn't look at you; he looks at your file, his lip curled in a sneer.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              "So, Ms. Mai says you've lost your motivation," he says, his voice dripping with condescension. "Grades are slipping. Feeling sad?" He says the word "sad" as if it's a dirty word.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              An tried to explain. He talked about the pressure, the exhaustion, the feeling of emptiness. Mr. Binh, however, waved a dismissive hand.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              "Depression? That's a Western disease for rich kids with too much time. You have food, home, and parents who sacrifice for you. You're being selfish and ungrateful," he declares. "What you need is discipline, not pity. You should look at yourself instead and stop wasting my time."
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              His words hit An like a physical blow, knocking the air from your lungs. An wasn't just misunderstood; he was condemned. The one door he tried to open was slammed in your face. You are the problem. Your feelings are a weakness. You are utterly, completely alone.

              So An decided, "Okay, I just need more discipline." He went out and bought a pack of energy drinks. Sleep is a luxury that he can't afford.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white/70">
              For a week, he lived in this caffeine-fueled haze. He finished his assignments, he memorized the notes, but none of it was actually sticking. His brain just felt like a soggy sponge.

            <p class="text-white/70">
              The night before the final physics exam, he was just staring at pages of equations, and they might as well be hieroglyphics. He hadn't slept in almost forty hours. His hands were shaking and his heart was pounding. He started to feel this weird, detached sensation, like he's watching himself from the ceiling.

            <p class="text-white/70">
              You've successfully protected your secret. But in doing so, you've pushed away the one person who might have helped. The loneliness intensifies. You go home and apologize to your mother, not because you believe you were wrong, but because the conflict is too tiring.

            <p class="text-white/70">
              And An was totally expecting a pep talk. Instead, she just listened. She didn't interrupt once. When he was done, she was quiet for a moment. Then she said, "That sounds incredibly hard. I'm sorry, An."

              She didn't try to offer solutions or tell him he was wrong. She just sat with him in his sadness. Then she bought him a lychee tea, and they just sat there together in this really comfortable silence. For the first time in months, the heavy weight on his shoulders felt just a little bit lighter. It's not like he was fixed or anything. But he wasn't alone anymore. And that felt like everything.
